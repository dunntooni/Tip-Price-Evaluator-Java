# Overview

This is a tip calculating program where the user may input a bill amount and select several different means of calculating a tip.
These include:
1. The user inputting a percentage of their bill.
2. The user giving their server a rating from 1 to 5 stars.
3. The user manually inputting their desired tip amount.

It then calculates the total price of their bill and displays it.
Originally there was extensive error-checking, but due to time constraints, it had to be scrapped.
